# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

## Overview

* In this activity, we build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from our users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

* We used Express to handle routing and deploy our app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
